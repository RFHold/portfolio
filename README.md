## Robert Holden's Portfolio

This is my portfolio. There are many like it, but this one is mine.

### About Me
With a passion for solving problems I started my career path early in highschool with my first job building website templates. I enjoy the logistical aspect of programming with every day being a new opportunity for something great. I am a quick and focused learner who actively looks and avoids complications before they become a roadblock. I am looking for a place to let me express my best concepts and use my skills to their fullest potential.

### Portfolio
#### WatchPad
WatchPad is a simple tool which allows the user to organize and keep track of movies and tv shows that they want to watch. Combining apis such as The Movie Database and TV Database to allow the user to search the ever expanding collection of todays media. With future plans to integrate with media servers such as Plex and Emby, WatchPad will be a great asset to anyone looking to create their own media server.

### Experience

#### 501CiO Consulting
3 Years Fullstack Developer
I started work at 501CiO making css templates for client websites. Six months later I began developing a time-sheet and invoicing system for internal use. During development I got ample experience with languages such as PHP, Ruby, and JavaScript. I also utilized MySQL, Rails, Node.js, Angular.js and many other technologies. As lead developer, I used my creative thinking and ambitious personality to solve problems and fabricate a great user experience.

#### Cellairis
8 Months Lead Sales/Repair Tech
At Cellairis I was charged with repairing customer devices which included replacing or repairing components, troubleshooting software issues, data recovery, and cleaning PCs. On top of being a repair tech, I was also Lead Sales. As the Lead Sales Associate I communicated with customers about their repair and order status as well as maintain the store to both optimize workflow and display our products effectively. My time at Cellairis tested my ability to multitask and communicate with the rest of my team.

#### FRC Robotics
3 Seasons Lead Programmer/Electrical
During 3 of my years in highschool, I lead the programming team for team 4749 in FRC Robotics. Throughout my time there, I utilized Java and C++ to program a control interface, perform vision processing, and communicate with motor controllers or other modules.
